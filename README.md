# Use MDE in an Shiny App 

### Proof of Concept: Can we store the values in MDE in a shiny.collection?

We use <a href="https://simplemde.com/" target="_blank">SimpleMDE -  Markdown Editor</a> a simple Markdown Editor to collect user input. 

This input is stored in shiny.collections `rethinkdb` and could later be integrated into a Markdown Report.
